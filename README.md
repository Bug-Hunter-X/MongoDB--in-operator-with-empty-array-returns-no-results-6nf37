# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns an empty result set, even if the field being queried is optional or might contain null values.

The issue arises because `$in` expects at least one element in the input array; an empty array evaluates to no match.

The solution explains how to effectively handle such scenarios to ensure the query behaves as intended, returning results that match even when the target field is missing or contains null values.
